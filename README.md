This project is a CV evaluation system that leverages the LLaMA-3.3-70B-Versatile model, combined with advanced prompt engineering techniques, to analyze and evaluate resumes based on a specific job offer. The system compares the CV to the job description, identifies matches, gaps, and areas for improvement, and provides detailed feedback to help recruiters or hiring managers make informed decisions.
