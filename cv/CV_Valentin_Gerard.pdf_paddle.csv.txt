EXPERIENCE
. Institut FEMTO-ST, Computer Science Department
June 2023 - September 2023
Deep Learning Research Intern
Belfort, France
Designed and trained a model for the automated detection of R-waves in highly noisy electrocardiograms (ECGs).
To address this challenge, we introduced artificial noise into our training dataset, which originally comprised clear
ECGs and we evaluated the performance of our model using highly noisy ECG data provided by Dijon Hospital.
I employed models designed to process the ECG through its time-frequency representation. Then, I leveraged a
Transformer model that combines information from both the time-frequency representation and the time series
data of ECGs.

Deep Learning Research Intern, MULTISPEECH Team
Nancy, France
Designed and trained more efficient neural network architectures for audiovisual speech generative modeling using
variational autoencoders. Speech perception involves both the acoustic modality and the visual modality, specif-
ically the lip movements of the speaker. We focused on an encoder to encode the input signal using both speech
 tion. I delved into exploring Transformer based models to capture temporal dependencies within the signal..
