Classes Preparatoires aux Grandes Ecoles 
Lycee Georges Clemenceau, Nantes, (France) 
A 2-year undergraduate program for preparation to national competitive exams for admission to 
the most prestigious French graduate schools of engineering. Major in Advanced and Applied 
Mathematics, Computer Science & Physics, Engineering Science 
* 
Project: Study of the stability of a tank truck according to the shape of its tank.  
 
Study of fluid mechanics and building of what needed to perform the experiments  
 
Construction of a miniature tank truck which can move at a constant acceleration 
speed.  
 
First experiment with coloured fluid which was filmed. Goal: to study the evolution of 
the barycentre according to the time and the acceleration thanks to image processing 
on the films 
 
Second experiment to study the pressure forces on the sidewalls of the tank thanks 
to pressure captors and accelerometers.  
 
Variation of the acceleration to obtain curves representing the movement of the 
barycentre or points.  
 
Numerical fluid simulations to compare the results of pressures forces and 
barycentre evolution with the experiments to find the best shape for the tank.
